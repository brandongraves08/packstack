# Packstack Application Rules

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for frontend development
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Keep API calls in separate files from UI components
- Use getApiUrl() instead of hard-coded URLs

## Git Workflow
- Create feature branches from main
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Update futurefeatures.md with all changes

## Environment
- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Always use .env for environment-specific configurations

## Testing
- Write tests for critical components
- Run tests before creating pull requests
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing

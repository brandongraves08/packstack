- [x] Adjusted apprunner.yaml to work with App Runner's source directory configuration (placed in /server directory with adjusted paths).
- [x] Fixed apprunner.yaml configuration by removing unsupported fields (protocol) and using only the supported network properties (port). Set port to 8080 for the Flask backend.

## Code Analysis (2025-04-29)

### Bugs and Issues
- `analyze_image` endpoint lacks file size validation (`MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`) and robust cleanup on failure.
- Amazon wrappers misuse PA API endpoints and signature:
  - `search_products` signs empty query params and posts to `/paapi5/getitems` instead of `/searchitems`.
  - `get_product_details` references undefined `asin` variable in payload.
- Mock auth endpoints (`register_user`, `login_user`, `update_user`) do not enforce input schemas, risking KeyError on missing fields.
- Inconsistent logging: error handlers use `print` instead of `app.logger`, bypassing structured logs.
- CORS is overly permissive (`*` origins, all methods), posing security risks.
- External API calls use blocking `requests`, with no retry/backoff or caching.
- Test endpoints print sensitive API keys to console.

### Improvements
- Enforce upload limits via `app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH']` to prevent large-file abuse.
- Adopt Marshmallow or Pydantic for request validation, serialization, and error messages.
- Replace synchronous `requests` with `httpx.AsyncClient` and implement retry/backoff logic.
- Refactor `app.py` into Flask Blueprints (auth, items, external APIs) for modularity.
- Centralize configuration in `config.py`, loading env-specific settings.
- Use `app.logger` consistently and remove `print` statements for error logging.
- Add caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequent external API responses (weather, product search).

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate S3 (or CDN) for image storage and automated cleanup.
- Support streaming responses for ChatGPT interactions to improve UX.
- Implement rate limiting (Flask-Limiter) to prevent endpoint abuse.
- Generate Swagger/OpenAPI docs (Flask-RESTX or flasgger) for all routes.
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for critical paths.
- Consider migrating to an async framework (FastAPI or Quart) for higher concurrency.

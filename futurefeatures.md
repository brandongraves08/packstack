  - Added diagnostic echo statements for better error tracing
  - Focused deployment on Flask backend to establish working server first
- [x] Added apprunner.yaml configuration for full-stack deployment (Flask backend + React frontend) to enable successful App Runner builds and deployments. Both servers are now started with concurrently, and dependencies/build steps for both are included.
- [x] Adjusted apprunner.yaml to work with App Runner's source directory configuration (placed in /server directory with adjusted paths).
- [x] Fixed apprunner.yaml configuration by removing unsupported fields (protocol) and using only the supported network properties (port). Set port to 8080 for the Flask backend.

  - This helps isolate whether build failures are due to environment or command syntax
- [x] Implemented workaround for App Runner build artifact requirement
  - Added 'mkdir -p build' to create a dummy build directory in the build phase
  - This satisfies App Runner's expectation for a build artifact and allows the build to succeed for backend-only deployments
- [x] Added `.env.example` to the backend (`server/.env.example`)
  - Documents all required environment variables for Flask backend
  - Ensures secure handling of secrets (never commit actual `.env`)
  - Reference for what to set in AWS App Runner environment variables

### In Progress

6. Frontend API URL configuration
   - **Fixed**: Updated VITE_API_URL to include the correct port (5001) for the Flask backend
7. User authentication - login and registration functionality
   - **Fixed**: Requires both frontend and backend servers to be running (frontend: 5173, backend: 5001)
   - **Note**: Backend provides mock authentication endpoints for testing

### Known Issues
1. Need to add server startup script to ensure the Flask server is running before using image analysis
   - **Completed**: Created start_server.bat script to initialize and run the Flask server
